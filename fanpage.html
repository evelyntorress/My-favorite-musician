    <h2 class="bi">Bio</h2>
    
    <p class="bio">Born and raised in Toronto, the artist started his musical career uploading songs to YouTube, until a producer discovered it and took him to the commercial circuit.
    That's how he became the superstar he is today. Currently, the Canadian singer has his own record label, XO, which makes him feel free to do whatever he wants.
     He has received numerous accolades, including four Grammy Awards, 19 Billboard Music Awards, 15 Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and an Academy Award nomination. </p>
